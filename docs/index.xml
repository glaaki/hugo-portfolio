The Incident: I built some tooling around automated playbook retries because the connection to some of our hosts is pretty bad (3G levels of bad&amp;hellip;); across ~5500 hosts something is almost guaranteed to fail.</description></item><item><title>The Keyboard Of Many Names</title><link>/posts/helidox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2019 11:55:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/helidox/</guid><description>my thoughts: Corne Keyboard, CRKBD, Helidox.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this thing has so many different names. I do know, however, that it is definitely my current favorite board. Same layout as the Iris but without the top number row. The OLED screens on the side are gimmicky but moving the TRRS jacks &amp;amp; controllers away from the keys allows this to stay much thinner, even without low profile switches.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Hello! My name is Sean Porter. I am a father, husband, and programmer. I have a general interest in all technology, but especially love seeing how software can improve our lives and disrupt established industries in a way that was never possible before. I make a intentional effort to get better every day.
I write application, CI, and infrastructure code; sometimes I get paged when a service goes down then I fix it so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item></channel></rss>
