I ignored their progress for a few years &amp;amp; now some entry level models like this Ender 3 are fairly affordable.
As is tradition, the first thing I did with it was use an arduino uno &amp;amp; get a bootloader + aftermarket firmare flashed onto the controller (Marlin, for anyone interested).
