After a few fan covers, tool holders &amp; LCD covers I was ready to start on a real project. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to organize the little nook on my desk for a while now; things tend to accumulate there until I notice and throw it all in a drawer.</p><p><img src=/shelf/shelf-pieces.jpg alt="shelf pieces" title="shelf pieces"></p><p>I found an stl file for some <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1511050>modular shelf brackets</a> &amp; scaled them down in Cura to fit <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; hardboard. I ripped down a bunch of matching shelf parts on my crosscut sled, then superglued the whole thing together. The middle shelf pieces are glued vertically but not horizontally so they still slide back &amp; forth if I want to adjust the section sizes.</p><p><img src=/shelf/bracket-pic.jpg alt="bracket pic" title="bracket pic"></p><p>Overall I&rsquo;m very pleased with how this turned out, now my small electronics have a good home.</p><p><img src=/shelf/finished-shelf.jpg alt="finished shelf" title="finished shelf">
