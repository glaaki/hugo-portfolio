The CRKBD, Corne keyboard, Helidox.
# my thoughts:

I don't know why this thing has so many different names. I _do_ know, however, that it is definitely my current favorite board. Same layout as the Iris but without the top number row. The OLED screens on the side are gimmicky but moving the TRRS jacks & controllers away from the keys allows this to stay much thinner, even without low profile switches.

# build notes:
The surface mount LEDs under the keycaps are an absolute _bear_ to solder, I burned through all 8 of my spares before I even finished the first side. Flux definitely helps here and I wouldn't even attempt them unless you've got a temp-controlled soldering iron. If you don't want to deal with the SMD LEDs at all, the PCB does have pinouts for regular LED strips that you can use for underglow instead.

The purple switches are Kailh BOX Royals (heavy tactiles) and the yellow modifiers are BOX Dark Yellow (heavy linears). I swapped out the pro micro on the master side to an Elite-C instead, no code changes are necessary and it's a much stronger USB-C port.

Switches were from [novelkeys](https://novelkeys.xyz/), controllers were from [keeb.io](https://keeb.io/), pcbs were sourced from [keyhive](https://keyhive.xyz/) and cases were cut by [stratakb](https://stratakb.com/). Thanks to foostan for designing such a great keyboard; docs & more info are up on his [github](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd).
