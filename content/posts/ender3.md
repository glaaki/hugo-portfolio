# Ender 3 + New Shelf
I finally picked up a 3d printer! I ignored their progress for a few years & now some entry level models like this Ender 3 are fairly affordable.

As is tradition, the first thing I did with it was use an arduino uno & get a bootloader + aftermarket firmare flashed onto the controller ([Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin), for anyone interested). The default firmware doesn't have thermal runaway protection so this should make it a bit safer.

The second order of business was to start printing upgrades for the printer. After a few fan covers, tool holders & LCD covers I was ready to start on a real project. I've been wanting to organize the little nook on my desk for a while now; things tend to accumulate there until I notice and throw it all in a drawer.

I found an stl file for some [modular shelf brackets](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1511050) & scaled them down in Cura to fit 1/8" hardboard. I ripped down a bunch of matching shelf parts on my crosscut sled, then superglued the whole thing together. The middle shelf pieces are glued vertically but not horizontally so they still slide back & forth if I want to adjust the section sizes.

Overall I'm very pleased with how this turned out, now my small electronics have a good home.
