# New 3D Printer
I finally picked up a 3d printer! I ignored their progress for a few years & now some entry level models like this Ender 3 are affordable.

As is tradition, the first thing I did with it was use an arduino uno & get a bootloader + aftermarket firmare flashed onto the controller ([Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin), for anyone interested). The default firmware doesn't have thermal runaway protection so this should make it a bit safer.

The second order of business was to start printing upgrades for the printer. After a few fan covers, tool holders & LCD covers I was ready to start on a real project. I've been wanting to organize the little nook on my desk for a while now; things tend to accumulate there until I notice and throw it all in a drawer.

I found an stl file for some [modular shelf brackets](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1511050) & scaled them down in Cura to fit 1/8" hardboard. I ripped down a bunch of matching shelf parts on my crosscut sled, then superglued the whole thing together. The middle shelf pieces are glued to the brackets for structure but they still slide back & forth if I want to adjust the section sizes.

Overall I'm very pleased with how this turned out, now my small electronics have a good home.
