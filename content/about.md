# Hello!

My name is Sean Porter. I am a father, husband, and programmer. I have a general interest in all technology, but especially love seeing how software can improve our lives and disrupt established industries in a way that was never possible before. I make a intentional effort to get better every day.

I write both infrastructure and application code; sometimes I get paged when a service goes down, then I fix it so it doesn't. I'm currently based in the Springfield, MO area but open to opportunities elsewhere if something should come along.

On my off time I enjoy spending time with my family and the occasional round of disc golf. Ask me about my:

- Keyboards
- Woodworking
- 3D Printing

I love to make functional and cool stuff!
